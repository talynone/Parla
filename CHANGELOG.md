## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Two installer variants produced by the CI release workflow: CPU (canonical, auto-update capable) and CUDA (NVIDIA GPU acceleration via cuda-whisper + cuda-llama + cuda-onnx features)
- `cuda` Cargo meta-feature enabling all three CUDA sub-features at once
- Auto-updater via GitHub Releases with `tauri-plugin-updater`
- CI release workflow signing artifacts with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Internationalization (i18n) infrastructure with English, French and Spanish locales
- Language selector in the Settings panel
- Prompt detection from trigger words in transcripts (parity with VoiceInk `PromptDetectionService`)
- Multi-format clipboard backup/restore on Windows (images, files, HTML, RTF)
- `transcription/engine.rs` module mirroring VoiceInk `VoiceInkEngine.swift`
- HTTP timeout helpers for all batch cloud providers + WebSocket handshake timeout for streaming providers
- URL validator for user-configurable endpoints (Custom OpenAI-compat, Ollama)
- `source:changed` event replacing UI polling in the AI Models panel
- Unit tests for hotkeys state machine, cloud catalog, enhancement helpers and prompt detection (69 tests total)

### Changed
- Restrictive CSP on the webview (`default-src 'self'` baseline with targeted allowances)
- `parking_lot::Mutex` unified across the backend (previously one site used `std::sync::Mutex`)
- `TranscriptionSource` type extracted to `src/lib/tauri.ts` (was duplicated in two panels)
- README rewritten in English with VoiceInk-inspired structure

### Removed
- Unused `thiserror` dependency

### Fixed
- Toggle mode hotkey never ending a recording via press (now sets hands-free on release, matching VoiceInk)
- Cloud transcription providers hanging indefinitely on network failure (120s timeout + 15s connect timeout)
