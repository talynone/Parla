## Overview

### What is it?

**Parla** is a native Windows app that transcribes your voice to text and pastes it at your cursor, with a full pipeline that goes far beyond raw transcription:

- **Accurate transcription** via local Whisper (whisper.cpp), NVIDIA Parakeet (ONNX Runtime), or cloud providers.
- **Privacy-first by default** - you can run the whole pipeline (transcription + LLM enhancement) 100% offline.
- **Power Mode** - detects the foreground window and browser URL, then applies a pre-configured profile (which model, which LLM prompt, which dictionary) automatically.
- **Context aware** - the foreground window is captured + OCRed, and the extracted text is injected into the LLM enhancement prompt so the output matches what you were working on.
- **Global shortcuts** with configurable toggle, push-to-talk or hybrid mode, plus a double-Escape to cancel a recording.
- **Personal dictionary** of word replacements applied on every transcription (technical terms, product names, custom acronyms).
- **Prompt detection** via trigger words in your transcript - say "mail ..." and the Email prompt kicks in automatically.
- **Multilingual UI** - French, English, Spanish.
- **NVIDIA CUDA acceleration** for Whisper, Parakeet and local llama.cpp, with transparent CPU fallback.
- **Auto-updater** via GitHub Releases, so the app keeps itself in sync with new releases.

### Features

Compared to existing Windows dictation tools, Parla targets feature parity with VoiceInk on macOS:

- **Accurate transcription** with local (Whisper / Parakeet) or cloud (Groq, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Mistral, Soniox, Speechmatics, Gemini, Custom OpenAI-compat) models.
- **Streaming transcription** for providers that support it (ElevenLabs Scribe v2, Deepgram nova-3, Mistral voxtral RT, Soniox stt-rt-v4, Speechmatics).
- **LLM enhancement** with an embedded llama.cpp (GGUF models with CUDA), Ollama local, plus all major cloud providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter) and local CLI templates (pi / claude / codex) or a custom PowerShell command.
- **Smart modes** (prompts) configurable per-profile: Default cleanup, Assistant, Email, Chat, Rewrite, or any custom prompt you define.
- **Multi-format clipboard backup** - if you had an image, a file, or rich text in your clipboard, it is restored byte-for-byte after paste.
- **Non-focus-stealing overlay** recorder pill that floats above all windows without capturing focus (Win32 `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` + `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`).
- **History** stored in SQLite with CSV export and configurable retention.
- **Windows Credential Manager** for every API key - nothing is ever written to disk in plain text.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 (22H2) or later
- A microphone
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.x drivers for GPU-accelerated local transcription and LLM enhancement

## Get started

### Download

Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/LitteRabbit-37/Parla/releases) and grab `Parla_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe`. Works on every Windows 10 / 11 machine. Runs Whisper, Parakeet and llama.cpp on your CPU out of the box.

Auto-updater is built in: once installed, Parla checks `latest.json` on every start and offers to install new releases in place.

### GPU acceleration (NVIDIA CUDA)

The pre-built installer ships CPU-only because compiling whisper.cpp + llama.cpp + ggml-cuda does not fit in our public CI runners' budget. Users with an NVIDIA GPU who want CUDA acceleration (typically 3 to 10 times faster on large models) build Parla themselves from source - see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#cuda-build) for the recipe. You will need the CUDA Toolkit 12.x installed plus Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ workload. The build takes 15 to 30 minutes on a reasonably recent desktop.

Once installed, Parla runs in the system tray. The default global shortcut for recording is configurable from the `Recorder` panel in the app.

### Build from source

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for the detailed instructions. Quick version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LitteRabbit-37/Parla.git
cd Parla
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

For a release build:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

## Known limitations

### Recording does not work inside apps launched as administrator

Parla uses a global low-level keyboard hook to detect its recording shortcut (Right Alt by default). Windows UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation) prevents a non-elevated process from receiving keyboard events destined for a window of higher integrity level. In practice, this means that when a terminal, an editor, or any other application has been started with **Run as administrator**, the Parla hotkey is silently swallowed while that elevated window has keyboard focus, and no recording starts.

The proper fix is to ship Parla with a manifest flag `uiAccess=true`, which Windows honors on **code-signed** binaries installed under `C:\Program Files`. We do not currently have an Authenticode code-signing certificate, so this is not available yet.

Workarounds until we sign the releases:

- Use a non-elevated terminal whenever possible. Windows Terminal, PowerShell and Command Prompt only need administrator rights for a very small set of commands.
- If you genuinely need an elevated terminal, run Parla as administrator as well (right-click `parla.exe` > Run as administrator). Both processes then share the same integrity level and the hotkey is delivered. Note that an administrator Parla cannot paste into non-elevated applications - UIPI enforces the rule symmetrically.
- Give focus to a non-elevated window before triggering the hotkey, then switch back.

This limitation is a property of Windows, not a bug in Parla. It will be removed in a future release when signed installers are available.
